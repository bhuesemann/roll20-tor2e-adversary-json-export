# Roll20 Adversary Importer for The One Ring 2e

This little project is divided in two parts:
1. Parse and extract a list of all adversaries with their properties from the core rules pdf and save the list as structured JSON.
2. Use the adversary JSON help loremasters to select and import adversaries to a Roll20 game as easy as possible.
